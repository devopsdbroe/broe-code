						<p>
							Welcome to Broe Code where I document my attempt at becoming a
							full stack web developer! Here, I&apos;ll share the projects
							I&apos;ve been working on, and the lessons I learn along the way.
						</p>
						<p>
							I plan to post here as frequently as possible. It&apos;s open to
							interpretation if that means only once a week or several times a
							day. It could be a bit of both depending how I&apos;m feeling on a
							given day.
						</p>
						<p>
							I&apos;ve found that discussion is one of the most effective ways
							to learn, so if I&apos;ve posted an article with incorrect
							information, I encourage you to let me know (politely, of course
							ðŸ™‚). I also welcome you to share your opinions on all of the
							topics I cover here. This would be a very boring place if we
							agreed on everything!
