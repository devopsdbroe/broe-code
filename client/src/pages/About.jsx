						<p>
							Welcome to Broe Code, where I document my attempt at becoming a
							full-stack web developer! Here, I&apos;ll share the projects
							I&apos;ve been working on and the lessons I&apos;ve learned along
							the way.
						</p>
						<p>
							I plan to post here frequently. It&apos;s open to interpretation
							whether that means only once a week or several times a day.
							Depending on how I&apos;m feeling on a given day, it could be a
							bit of both.
						</p>
						<p>
							I&apos;ve found that discussion is one of the most effective ways
							to learn, so if I&apos;ve posted an article with incorrect
							information, I encourage you to let me know (politely, of course
							ðŸ™‚). I also welcome you to share your opinions on the topics I
							cover here. This blog would be a very dull place if we agreed on
							everything!
